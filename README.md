Experienced Frontend Developers
Would you like to pave the way for Continia’s future online platform together with a team of creative and innovative developers? Continia is looking for two ambitious Frontend Developers, who can design and develop highly scalable web frontend.

If you are enthusiastic, naturally curious and have a passion for new technology, and if you aspire to contribute to one of the most important projects within Continia, you may be one of our two new Frontend Developers.

 

About your role

Continia is searching for both a junior and a senior Frontend Developer to join our team. Both positions require that you have some experience from a similar role and a proven record of building high-quality and well-tested code while keeping a strong eye on simplicity and maintainability.

Currently, our online team is building the next generation online platform based on Continia’s vision of having one platform that will work with all our applications and provide a unified and refreshing experience.

As a Frontend Developer, you will be part of building our online platform in close cooperation with other senior developers.

What you will be doing:

Collaborate with various teams to define requirements.
Investigate new frontend technologies and frameworks.
Develop and maintain a world-class responsive frontend framework and contribute to making incremental changes.
Build robust, cross-device compatible UI and features and ensure sufficient coverage with automated tests.
Strike a balance between shipping soon and finding a perfect solution and understand the trade-offs.
From a technology perspective, Continia is based on React, TypeScript, HTML5, and Node. We mainly integrate with RESTful APIs and use Microsoft Azure DevOps to manage the development teams, backlogs, and releases.
Dependent on your location, you can be based in one of our three development locations (Aalborg and Copenhagen in Denmark or Vilnius in Lithuania).

When you join Continia, you become an integral part of an innovative, entrepreneurial, and agile environment. We foster a flat organizational structure, empowering you to actively participate in decision-making processes that have a significant impact on our software, partnerships, and customers worldwide.

At Continia, we prioritize a culture-centric approach, fostering a mutual flexibility model that empowers you with freedom and responsibility, ensuring a healthy work-life balance.
